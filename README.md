# 5-star

The goal of this project is to implement a parser for Python language, using Context-free Grammar (CFG) or BNF with ANTLR . The parser reads an input file written in a simplified “FiveStar” language and produces both a parse tree and a token stream. The project also includes a Python driver (main.py) that handles file loading, lexing, parsing, error reporting, and printing the resulting tree.
